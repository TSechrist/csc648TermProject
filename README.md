### This is my class project for Fall 2019 software development at San Francisco State University. I worked in a team of 6 people and my primary focus was github control and code testing.

### The goal of this project was to make a usable web service that would be hosted on AWS which would provide a service for SFSU students, similar to craigslist. Students could make posting for products or services they would like to sell, post those with pictures to our service, then other students could contact the seller.
